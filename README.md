# Finite-Element-Method (FEM)
Numerical Method: Solving PDE's using Finite Element Method

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) that describe physical phenomena such as heat transfer, fluid flow, and structural mechanics. FEM is particularly useful for problems with complex geometries or material properties that cannot be solved analytically.

Installation
To use FEM, you will need to have a working installation of a programming language such as Python or MATLAB, as well as numerical libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. These libraries provide the necessary functions for performing numerical calculations and linear algebra operations.

Usage
To use FEM, you will need to follow several steps:

1. Define the mesh of nodes and elements that represent the problem domain.
2. Define the element stiffness matrices and force vectors using appropriate shape functions and numerical integration methods.
3. Assemble the global stiffness matrix and force vector by summing the contributions from each element.
4. Apply the boundary conditions to the system of equations to obtain a unique solution.
5. Solve the system of equations to obtain the nodal values of the solution.

To implement FEM in your own code, you can use the provided functions in a programming language such as Python or MATLAB, or you can write your own functions based on the principles of FEM.

Examples

1. Heat transfer in a solid object
2. Fluid flow in a pipe
3. Structural analysis of a building or bridge
4. Electromagnetic field analysis in a device

Limitations

1. It can be computationally expensive for large-scale problems.
2. It requires careful meshing of the problem domain to ensure accurate solutions.
3. It assumes that the material properties are constant within each element, which may not always be true in real-world problems.
4. It assumes that the shape functions used to interpolate the solution are accurate, which may not always be the case for complex geometries.

Conclusion
FEM is a versatile and powerful numerical technique that can be used to solve a wide range of PDEs in various fields. By understanding the principles of FEM and its limitations, you can apply this technique to your own problems and generate useful insights and predictions about the physical systems they describe.
